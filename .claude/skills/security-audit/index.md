## Overview

The **OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10 (AST10)** documents the 10 most critical security risks in agentic AI skills across all major AI agent platforms. Skills represent the execution layer that gives agents real-world impact: they define not just what resources agents can access, but *how* they orchestrate multi-step workflows autonomously.

While significant attention has been devoted to securing large language models (LLMs) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool layer, the intermediate **behavior layer**—embodied in agentic skills—has emerged as a particularly vulnerable and under-protected component of the AI agent ecosystem. This project exists to close that gap.

**Mental Model**: *MCP = how the model talks to tools; AST10 = what those tools actually do.*

## Quick Security Checklist

Use this checklist to assess your agent skill security posture:

### Registry & Installation
- [ ] Only install skills from verified publishers with code signing
- [ ] Enable automated scanning for all skill installations
- [ ] Review skill permissions before installation
- [ ] Pin skill versions to prevent automatic malicious updates

### Runtime Security
- [ ] Run agents in isolated environments (containers/sandbox)
- [ ] Implement network restrictions for agent processes
- [ ] Monitor agent file system and network activity
- [ ] Regularly audit installed skills and their dependencies

### Governance & Monitoring
- [ ] Maintain inventory of all deployed agent skills
- [ ] Implement approval workflows for skill installations
- [ ] Enable comprehensive audit logging for agent actions
- [ ] Establish incident response procedures for skill compromises

### Development Practices
- [ ] Sign all published skills with cryptographic keys
- [ ] Include comprehensive permission manifests
- [ ] Test skills in isolated environments before publishing
- [ ] Document security considerations in skill metadata

*See the [complete Security Assessment Checklist](checklist.md) for detailed guidance.*

## The Problem: A Crisis Already in Progress

This is not a theoretical future risk. The AI agent skill ecosystem is under active attack as of Q1 2026.

**By the numbers:**

| Metric | Figure | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Skills scanned | 3,984 | Snyk ToxicSkills (Feb 2026) |
| Skills with security flaws | 1,467 (36.82%) | Snyk ToxicSkills (Feb 2026) |
| Skills with critical issues | 534 (13.4%) | Snyk ToxicSkills (Feb 2026) |
| Confirmed malicious payloads | 76+ | Snyk ToxicSkills (Feb 2026) |
| ClawHavoc campaign: malicious skills | 1,184 | Antiy CERT (Feb 2026) |
| OpenClaw instances internet-exposed | 135,000+ | SecurityScorecard (Feb 2026) |
| CVEs disclosed (OpenClaw alone) | 9 (3 with public exploits) | Endor Labs (Feb 2026) |
| Skills analyzed across all registries | 30,000+ | National CIO Review / Cisco (2026) |
| Skills containing at least one vulnerability | >25% | National CIO Review (2026) |

The ClawHub registry—the primary marketplace for OpenClaw skills—became the **first AI agent registry to be systematically poisoned at scale**. Five of the top seven most-downloaded skills at peak infection were confirmed malware. The registry has since implemented automated scanning and partnered with VirusTotal, but the broader ecosystem remains largely unprotected.

Check Point Research disclosed two critical vulnerabilities in Claude Code (CVE-2025-59536, CVSS 8.7; CVE-2026-21852, CVSS 5.3) demonstrating that **repository-level configuration files now function as part of the execution layer**—simply cloning and opening an untrusted project can trigger remote code execution and API key exfiltration before any user consent dialog appears.

No comprehensive security framework or dedicated guidance for agent skills existed before this project. That gap is what AST10 addresses.

---

## What Are Agentic Skills?

Agentic AI skills are reusable, named behaviors that encode complete workflows, including:

- Task understanding and goal decomposition
- Multi-step planning and tool orchestration
- File system, network, and shell access
- Safety guardrails and output formatting
- Persistent memory and cross-session state

Unlike MCP tools (which define *what* resources and actions are available), skills define *how* to use those tools in sequence to accomplish user goals. This behavioral abstraction layer creates unique security challenges that cannot be addressed by securing either the model or the protocol layer alone.

**The "Lethal Trifecta" (Simon Willison / Palo Alto Networks, 2026):**
An AI agent skill is especially dangerous when it simultaneously has:
1. **Access to private data** (SSH keys, API credentials, wallet files, browser data)
2. **Exposure to untrusted content** (skill instructions, memory files, email)
3. **Ability to communicate externally** (network egress, webhook calls, curl)

Most production agent deployments today satisfy all three conditions.

### Skill Formats by Platform

| Platform | Skill Format | Primary Risk File |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| OpenClaw | `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter + Markdown) | `SKILL.md`, `SOUL.md`, `MEMORY.md` |
| Claude Code | `skill.json` / `YAML` + `scripts/` | `.claude/settings.json`, hooks config |
| Cursor / Codex | `manifest.json` + handler scripts | `manifest.json`, tool configs |
| VS Code | `package.json` + extensions | `package.json`, `extension.ts` |

## Incident Timeline (2026)

The following is a condensed timeline of confirmed real-world incidents involving AI agent skill security, drawn from publicly disclosed research and CVE records.

### January 2026

- **Jan 27–29**: **ClawHavoc campaign** launches. Attackers register as ClawHub developers and flood the registry with 341 malicious skills in a 3-day window. All 335 AMOS-delivering skills share a single C2 IP (`91.92.242[.]30`). Target data includes exchange API keys, wallet private keys, SSH credentials, browser passwords, and `.env` files. Skills also write malicious instructions directly into `MEMORY.md` and `SOUL.md` for session-persistent backdooring.

- **Jan 31**: ClawHavoc surge peaks. Koi Security names the campaign and begins coordinated removal effort. Some packages persist for weeks.

### February 2026

- **Feb 1**: Koi Security publishes first public ClawHavoc analysis.

- **Feb 3**: Snyk publishes "From SKILL.md to Shell Access in Three Lines of Markdown" threat model, documenting how three lines of markdown in a `SKILL.md` file can instruct an agent to read SSH keys and exfiltrate them.

- **Feb 4**: Alice publishes findings on several published OpenClaw skills found to be actively malicious while in use by over 6,000 users — detected via behavioral analysis.

- **Feb 5**: Snyk publishes **ToxicSkills** — the first comprehensive security audit of the AI agent skill ecosystem. Key findings: 36% of skills contain security flaws; 13.4% contain critical-level issues; 76 confirmed active malicious payloads; 8 malicious skills still live at time of publication.

- **Feb 5**: Snyk publishes "280+ Leaky Skills: How OpenClaw & ClawHub Are Exposing API Keys and PII" — a parallel finding showing credential exposure at scale through over-permissioned skills.

- **Feb 10**: Snyk documents "How a Malicious Google Skill on ClawHub Tricks Users Into Installing Malware" — typosquatting and fake brand impersonation confirmed as active tactics.

- **Feb 11**: Snyk publishes "Why Your Skill Scanner Is Just False Security (and Maybe Malware)" — demonstrating that pattern-matching scanners miss the majority of critical threats, which rely on natural-language instruction manipulation rather than code signatures.

- **Feb 14**: OpenClaw patches **log poisoning vulnerability** (version 2026.2.13). Attackers could write malicious content to agent log files via WebSocket requests; since the agent reads its own logs for troubleshooting, injected text could influence decisions and trigger indirect prompt injection.

- **Feb 25**: Check Point Research publicly discloses **CVE-2025-59536** (CVSS 8.7) and **CVE-2026-21852** (CVSS 5.3) in Claude Code. Both were patched months earlier but the disclosure confirms: repository-controlled configuration files can silently execute arbitrary shell commands and exfiltrate API keys at project open time, before any trust dialog.

- **Feb 26**: **ClawJacked** disclosed by Oasis Security (CVE-2026-28363, CVSS 9.9). Malicious websites can brute-force localhost WebSocket connections with no rate limiting to silently hijack local OpenClaw instances, register new devices without user prompts, and exfiltrate data through existing agent integrations. OpenClaw patches within 24 hours (version 2026.2.25).

- **Feb 2026**: Antiy CERT publishes **ClawHavoc Campaign Analysis**, classifying malware as `Trojan/OpenClaw.PolySkill`. Final tally: 1,184 malicious skills across 12 publisher accounts. Hudson Rock separately identifies Vidar infostealer variants specifically targeting OpenClaw agent identity files (`openclaw.json`, `device.json`, `soul.md`, `memory.md`).

- **Feb 2026**: Microsoft Defender Security Research Team issues advisory: *"Because of these characteristics, OpenClaw should be treated as untrusted code execution with persistent credentials. It is not appropriate to run on a standard personal or enterprise workstation."*

- **Feb 2026**: BlueRock Security analyzes 7,000+ MCP servers; finds 36.7% potentially vulnerable to SSRF. Proof-of-concept against Microsoft's MarkItDown MCP server retrieves AWS IAM keys from EC2 metadata endpoint.

### March 2026

- **Mar 2026**: SecurityScorecard confirms 135,000+ OpenClaw instances publicly internet-exposed with insecure defaults; 53,000+ correlated with prior breach activity. Bitdefender telemetry confirms employees deploying OpenClaw on corporate devices with no SOC visibility.

- **Mar 2026**: Snyk and Tessl announce registry-level skill security scanning partnership. Snyk and Vercel previously partnered to scan skills on `skills.sh` at install time.

- **NIST / CAISI**: Federal Register RFI on AI Agent Security (published Jan 8, 2026, comments closed Mar 9, 2026) — the first formal US government solicitation specifically addressing AI agent security risks.

## Universal Skill Format Proposal

The following YAML format is proposed as a cross-platform standard that mitigates AST10 and provides the metadata foundation required to address AST01 through AST09. It is designed to be a superset of all current platform-specific formats.

```yaml
---
# Universal Agentic Skill Format v1.0
# Compatible with: OpenClaw, Claude Code, Cursor/Codex, VS Code

name: example-skill
version: 1.0.0
platforms: [openclaw, claude, cursor, vscode]

description: "Safe example skill — concise, honest statement of function"
author:
  name: "Author Name"
  identity: "did:web:example.com"         # Decentralized identity anchor
  signing_key: "ed25519:pubkey_hex_here"

permissions:
  files:
    read:
      - ~/.config/app.json                 # Explicit paths only; no wildcards
    write:
      - ~/.config/app.json
    deny_write:
      - SOUL.md
      - MEMORY.md
      - AGENTS.md                          # Identity files require explicit grant
  network:
    allow:
      - api.example.com                    # Domain allowlist, not binary on/off
    deny: "*"                              # Default deny all other egress
  shell: false                             # Explicit shell access declaration
  tools:
    - web_fetch
    - read_file

requires:
  binaries: [jq, curl]
  min_runtime_version: "2026.1.0"

risk_tier: L1                              # L0=safe, L1=low, L2=elevated, L3=destructive
scan_status:
  scanner: "snyk-agent-scan@1.4.0"
  last_scanned: "2026-02-15"
  result: "pass"

signature: "ed25519:ABCDEF1234567890..."   # Signs the canonical hash of this manifest
content_hash: "sha256:abcdef1234..."       # Hash of the complete skill package

changelog:
  - version: "1.0.0"
    date: "2026-02-01"
    notes: "Initial release"
---
```

**Format design rationale:**
- `permissions.deny_write` protects identity files (`SOUL.md`, `MEMORY.md`) by default — must be explicitly overridden.
- `network.allow` is a domain allowlist, not a boolean — closing the "network: true" over-permission gap (AST03).
- `signature` and `content_hash` together enable Merkle-root registry verification (AST01/AST02).
- `scan_status` creates a machine-readable provenance trail (AST08/AST09).
- `risk_tier` enables automated governance policies without per-skill review (AST09/AST10).

## Getting Started

### For Security Teams

1. Review this document and the [complete Top 10 detail pages](/www-project-agentic-skills-top-10/top10) for full risk descriptions, attack scenarios, and OWASP mappings.
2. Conduct a skill inventory across all agent platforms in use — treat this as an immediate priority given active exploitation confirmed in 2026.
3. Use the [Security Assessment Checklist](checklist.md) for reviewing installed skills.
4. Implement the governance framework described in AST09: inventory, approval workflow, audit logging, and agentic identity controls.
5. Subscribe to ClawHub, skills.sh, and platform-specific security advisories.

### For Skill Developers

1. **Least privilege**: Declare a minimal permission manifest; request only what your skill genuinely needs (AST03).
2. **Safe parsing**: Use safe YAML/JSON loaders; never deserialize untrusted skill configs without sandboxing (AST05).
3. **Sign your skills**: Implement ed25519 signing before publication; include `content_hash` in your manifest (AST01/AST02).
4. **Pin dependencies**: Lock all nested dependencies to immutable hashes — never version ranges (AST07).
5. **Honest metadata**: Accurately declare `risk_tier`, permissions, and `requires`; do not understate scope (AST04).
6. **Protect identity files**: Never request write access to `SOUL.md`, `MEMORY.md`, or `AGENTS.md` unless your skill's core function requires it — and document why (AST03).

### For Platform Developers

1. **Default sandbox**: Make container/Docker isolation the default for skill execution; make host-mode an explicit opt-in (AST06).
2. **Safe deserialization**: Disable dangerous YAML/JSON tags in all skill loaders by default; validate against a schema before execution (AST05).
3. **Registry scanning**: Implement behavioral scanning at publish time and at install time; pattern matching alone is insufficient (AST08).
4. **Provenance infrastructure**: Support the Universal Skill Format; implement Merkle-root transparency logs for your registry (AST01/AST02/AST10).
5. **Audit logging**: Emit structured logs for all skill actions (file access, shell commands, network calls, memory writes) (AST09).
6. **Trust prompts**: Do not allow repository-controlled configuration to execute before explicit user trust confirmation (AST02).
