# OWASP AST10 API Documentation

The OWASP AST10 API provides programmatic access to security data, risk assessment tools, and integration capabilities for AI agent skill security.

> **⚠️ Status: Proposed specification — not yet deployed.**
> This page describes a *planned* API design published for community feedback. The base URL, dashboard, SDK packages, and support addresses below are **illustrative placeholders and are not live** — requests to them will fail. For example, `https://owasp.org/ast10/dashboard` returns **404** and the `https://api.owasp.org/ast10/v1` host does not resolve. No version of this API is currently running. Track implementation status in the [project issues](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-agentic-skills-top-10/issues).

## Base URL
```
https://api.owasp.org/ast10/v1
```
*Placeholder host — not yet deployed; this address does not resolve.*

## Authentication

Once the service is deployed, API requests will require authentication using API keys issued from an OWASP AST10 dashboard. **That dashboard does not exist yet** — the previously documented URL (`https://owasp.org/ast10/dashboard`) returns 404. The flow below is illustrative of the planned design.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://api.owasp.org/ast10/v1/risks
```

### Webhooks

#### Scan Completion Webhook
When a scan completes, we'll POST to your callback URL:

```json
{
  "event": "scan.completed",
  "scan_id": "scan_1234567890",
  "status": "completed",
  "results_summary": {
    "vulnerabilities_found": 2,
    "highest_severity": "high"
  },
  "report_url": "https://api.owasp.org/ast10/v1/scans/scan_1234567890/report"
}
```

### Rate Limits

*Proposed tiers — illustrative only; no live service enforces these today.*

- **Free Tier**: 100 requests/hour, 1,000/month
- **Professional**: 1,000 requests/hour, 100,000/month
- **Enterprise**: Unlimited

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

### Error Handling

All errors follow this format:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
    "message": "The request body is invalid",
    "details": {
      "field": "skill_content",
      "issue": "cannot be empty"
    }
  }
}
```

Common error codes:
- `INVALID_REQUEST`: Malformed request
- `UNAUTHORIZED`: Invalid or missing API key
- `RATE_LIMITED`: Rate limit exceeded
- `NOT_FOUND`: Resource not found
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`: Server error

### SDKs and Libraries

*Proposed client libraries. These packages are **not yet published** — `@owasp/ast10-sdk` (npm), `ast10_sdk` (PyPI), and `ast10-sdk-go` do not exist on their registries yet. The snippets below illustrate the intended interface.*

#### JavaScript/Node.js
```javascript
const { AST10Client } = require('@owasp/ast10-sdk');

const client = new AST10Client({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key'
});

// Assess a skill
const assessment = await client.assessSkill(skillContent);
console.log(`Risk score: ${assessment.overall_risk_score}`);

// Get threat intelligence
const threats = await client.getThreats({ severity: 'high' });
```

#### Python
```python
from ast10_sdk import AST10Client

client = AST10Client(api_key='your-api-key')

# Assess skill
assessment = client.assess_skill(skill_content)
print(f"Risk score: {assessment['overall_risk_score']}")

# Get risks
risks = client.get_risks()
```

#### Go
```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/owasp/ast10-sdk-go"
)

func main() {
    client := ast10.NewClient("your-api-key")
    
    assessment, err := client.AssessSkill(skillContent)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    
    fmt.Printf("Risk score: %.1f\n", assessment.OverallRiskScore)
}
```

### Changelog

#### v1.1.0 (March 2026)
- Added threat intelligence endpoints
- Enhanced risk assessment with ML-based scoring
- Added webhook support for scan completion

#### v1.0.0 (January 2026)
- Initial release with core AST10 endpoints
- Basic risk assessment and scanning
- Rate limiting and authentication

### Support

This is a proposed specification — there is no live API support channel yet. Use the project's GitHub repository for questions and to follow implementation:

- **Issue Tracking**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-agentic-skills-top-10/issues)

(The previously listed `https://api.owasp.org/ast10/docs` reference site and `api-support@owasp.org` mailbox are not deployed and do not work.)
